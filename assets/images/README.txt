PROFILE PICTURE SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
===================================

To add your profile picture:

1. Download the puppy image from this Pinterest link:
   https://i.pinimg.com/736x/04/8b/8d/048b8dbc061a104f266176b1b7bf828c.jpg

2. Save the image as "profile.jpg" in this folder:
   assets/images/profile.jpg

3. Run these commands in the terminal:
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   flutter run

The image will then appear in your profile screen!

Alternative: If you want to use a different image, just name it "profile.jpg" 
and place it in this assets/images/ folder.

Image requirements:
- Format: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- Recommended size: 512x512 pixels or larger
