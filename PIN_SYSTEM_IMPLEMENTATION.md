# 6-Digit PIN Code System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
A complete 6-digit PIN authentication system has been added to the KimPay Wallet app to provide an additional security layer.

## Files Created

### 1. `lib/services/pin_service.dart`
**Purpose**: Core service for PIN management and validation

**Key Features**:
- Secure PIN storage using SHA-256 hashing
- PIN validation with constant-time comparison
- Methods available:
  - `isPinSet()` - Check if user has set up a PIN
  - `setPin(String pin)` - Set a new PIN (validates 6-digit numeric format)
  - `verifyPin(String pin)` - Verify entered PIN against stored hash
  - `changePin(String oldPin, String newPin)` - Change existing PIN (requires old PIN)
  - `resetPin()` - Reset/remove PIN (use with additional authentication)

**Security Features**:
- SHA-256 cryptographic hashing
- No plain-text PIN storage
- Input validation (6-digit numeric only)
- Uses `shared_preferences` for persistent storage

### 2. `lib/widgets/pin_input_widget.dart`
**Purpose**: Reusable 6-digit PIN input component

**Features**:
- 6 individual input fields with auto-focus navigation
- Backspace handling to move to previous field
- Customizable obscure text (default: true)
- Enable/disable state support
- OnCompleted callback when all 6 digits entered
- OnChanged callback for validation clearing
- Material 3 design with focused/enabled borders
- `clear()` method to reset all fields

### 3. `lib/screens/pin_setup_screen.dart`
**Purpose**: Screen for creating or changing PIN

**Flow**:
1. Enter 6-digit PIN
2. Confirm by re-entering PIN
3. Validation (must match)
4. Success confirmation

**Features**:
- Two-step verification (enter + confirm)
- Mismatch error handling with field clearing
- Loading states during PIN save
- Support for both initial setup and PIN change modes
- Success callback for navigation
- Visual feedback with icons and error messages
- Tips section for best practices

### 4. `lib/screens/pin_verify_screen.dart`
**Purpose**: Screen for verifying user's PIN

**Features**:
- Attempt limiting (default: 5 attempts, configurable)
- Account lockout after max failed attempts
- Remaining attempts counter
- "Forgot PIN?" option with dialog
- Success callback for navigation
- Optional back button (configurable)
- Visual states: normal, loading, locked
- Error messages with attempt tracking

## Files Modified

### 5. `lib/screens/splash_screen.dart`
**Changes**: Integrated PIN check into app launch flow

**New Logic**:
```
Splash Screen (2.5s delay)
  ↓
Check if PIN is set (PinService.isPinSet())
  ↓
  ├─ PIN exists → Navigate to PinVerifyScreen
  │                ↓ (on success)
  │                Dashboard
  └─ No PIN → Navigate to PinSetupScreen
                ↓ (on completion)
                Dashboard
```

### 6. `lib/screens/profile_screen.dart`
**Changes**: Added "Change PIN" option in Security section

**Location**: Security section (first item)
**Icon**: `Icons.pin`
**Flow**: 
```
Profile → Change PIN → PinVerifyScreen (verify current)
                        ↓ (on success)
                        PinSetupScreen (set new PIN, isChangingPin: true)
```

### 7. `pubspec.yaml`
**Added Dependencies**:
```yaml
# Storage & Security
shared_preferences: ^2.3.4  # For persistent PIN storage
crypto: ^3.0.6              # For SHA-256 hashing
```

## User Flows

### First-Time Setup
1. User completes onboarding
2. Splash screen checks for PIN (none exists)
3. User is directed to PIN Setup screen
4. User enters 6-digit PIN
5. User confirms PIN by re-entering
6. Success → Navigate to Dashboard

### Subsequent App Launches
1. User opens app
2. Splash screen checks for PIN (exists)
3. User is directed to PIN Verification screen
4. User enters 6-digit PIN
5. Success → Navigate to Dashboard
6. Failure → Shows error, decrements attempts
7. After 5 failures → Account locked (temp)

### Changing PIN from Settings
1. User navigates to Profile → Security
2. Tap "Change PIN"
3. Verify current PIN (PinVerifyScreen)
4. Enter new 6-digit PIN
5. Confirm new PIN
6. Success → Navigate back to Profile

### Forgot PIN Flow
1. User taps "Forgot PIN?" on verification screen
2. Dialog appears explaining reset requires login
3. User chooses:
   - Cancel → Return to PIN entry
   - Reset → Return to login/onboarding (TODO: implement full reset flow)

## Security Considerations

✅ **Implemented**:
- PIN hashing with SHA-256
- No plain-text storage
- Input validation (6 digits only)
- Attempt limiting (prevents brute force)
- Account lockout after max attempts
- Secure storage with `shared_preferences`

⚠️ **Recommendations for Production**:
- Consider using `flutter_secure_storage` for even more secure storage
- Implement biometric authentication as alternative
- Add server-side PIN verification for cloud-synced accounts
- Implement time-based lockout (e.g., 30 minutes after 5 failed attempts)
- Add PIN expiration/rotation policy
- Log security events (failed attempts, PIN changes)

## Testing Checklist

Before deploying, test the following scenarios:

- [ ] First-time user setup (no PIN exists)
- [ ] App restart after PIN setup (verification required)
- [ ] Correct PIN entry (should navigate to dashboard)
- [ ] Incorrect PIN entry (should show error and decrement attempts)
- [ ] 5 consecutive failed attempts (should lock account)
- [ ] Change PIN from settings (verify old → set new)
- [ ] Mismatched PIN confirmation during setup
- [ ] Forgot PIN flow
- [ ] App state after orientation change
- [ ] Back button behavior on PIN screens

## Installation Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

2. **Clear any cached builds** (recommended):
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Usage Examples

### Check if PIN is set
```dart
final bool hasPin = await PinService.isPinSet();
```

### Set a new PIN
```dart
final bool success = await PinService.setPin('123456');
```

### Verify PIN
```dart
final bool isValid = await PinService.verifyPin('123456');
```

### Change PIN
```dart
final bool changed = await PinService.changePin('123456', '654321');
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the PIN system:

1. **Biometric Integration**: Add fingerprint/Face ID as alternative to PIN
2. **PIN Complexity Rules**: Option to require non-sequential digits
3. **Session Management**: Keep user logged in for X minutes after PIN entry
4. **Cloud Backup**: Sync PIN (hashed) across devices
5. **Emergency Reset**: Alternative recovery method via email/SMS
6. **PIN History**: Prevent reusing last N PINs
7. **Custom PIN Length**: Allow 4-8 digit PINs
8. **Pattern Lock**: Alternative visual pattern authentication

## Notes

- All PIN screens follow Material 3 design system
- Responsive to theme changes (light/dark mode ready)
- Accessibility: Large input fields, clear error messages
- Error states provide helpful user guidance
- Loading states prevent double-submission
- Clean navigation flow with proper route replacement

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check that `flutter pub get` has been run
2. Verify `shared_preferences` and `crypto` packages are installed
3. Ensure you're using Flutter SDK >= 3.6.2
4. Check console for any error messages
